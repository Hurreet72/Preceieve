# Preceieve 
A web-based application that converts speech to corresponding sign language animations, enabling better communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

This project uses **Python**, **Speech Recognition**, and **OpenCV / MediaPipe** along with a **web frontend** to detect spoken words and translate them into animated sign language gestures.


## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 Real-time Speech Recognition
- ✋ Converts recognized speech into Sign Language gesture animations
- 🌐 Simple and interactive web interface
- 🔴 Emergency detection alert
- 📦 Easy to install & run locally
- 🧠 Built using Machine Learning and Computer Vision


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Frontend | Backend / ML | Tools | HTML, CSS, JS | Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / MediaPipe | Git, Flask, SpeechRecognition |
